				<h6 class="text-left h-bold">WHY RICHMOND UNITED?</h6>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Richmond United isn't just about soccer. We believe that it is a tool with which we can encourage our youth to persevere and pursue a brighter future. While we wish our teams success on the field, the true measure of success is to develop responsible youth who succeed in life.</p>
				<h6 class="text-left"><b>HISTORY</b></h6>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Richmond United Soccer Club was founded in 1995 by members of the community interested in providing youth with an opportunity to play soccer. Since then, the club has seen many members come and go but recently has seen a tremendous upward trend in participation. This is due to the quality of the program, which promotes fun, development, and education. Moreover, it is due to its volunteers that have worked diligently to implement strong values and a vision that encourages our community to reach for higher goals.
				</p>
				<h6 class="text-left "><b>MISSION</b></h6>
				<p class="text-justify">With the help of the sport of soccer, to develop our children into responsible citizens who will become the future leaders of our community.</p>

					<h6 class="text-left"><b>AFFORDABILITY</b></h6>
					<p class="text-justify">
						We believe playing youth soccer should be accessible to everyone. Whether you play competitive soccer or recreational soccer, our registration fees are some of the most affordable in the area. We work hard to stretch your fees by obtaining apparel and equipment for coaches through sponsorship and we also provide every single player with one soccer ball each year. We are proud to provide as much as we can while being one of the lowest price options around.</p>
					<br>
					<h6 class="text-left h-bold">WHAT WE OFFER</h6>
					<p class="text-justify">
						During the spring and fall seasons, we play against teams from Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, San Pablo, Oakland, and beyond.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						For U-9 through U-19 teams, we offer a competitive program through Nor Cal, from Bronze to Premier. You can play against some of the best competition throughout the Bay Area.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						For us, this component is critical. We organize trips to various colleges and conferences. In the past, our U19 girls attended a national conference for Hispanic Engineers in Anaheim, CA.
					</p>
					<h6 class="text-left"><b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b></h6>
					<p class="text-justify">We are part of the Alameda Contra Costa Youth Soccer League, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting youth soccer. RUSC is currently composed of 36 teams (24 Boys Teams and 10 Girls Teams) and a U-6 "pee-wee" program. The 30+ teams range from U-8 to U-19 teams. The U-6 program is available for boys and girls ages 4 to 6. RUSC welcomes boys and girls (ages 4 to 18) to participate, regardless of experience or background.</p>

					<h6 class="text-left"><b>OUR GROWTH</b></h6>
					<p class="text-justify">
						RUSC has grown tremendously over the past six years. We believe that this growth is attributed to our increased focus on education and discipline along with the quality of the program. Our mission has resonated with the community and has led to the increase in growth.

					<p class="text-justify">We expect to continue growing with parents and players that share our vision. There are many more youth that have yet to play team sports we estimate that there are thousands of youth in Richmond who do not play a sport, we plan to reach out and encourage them to play and engage in a positive activity.</p>
